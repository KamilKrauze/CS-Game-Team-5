Dambuster is a two player game. One player plays as the RAF and controls three fighterplanes and a dambuster. Their objective is to drop the bouncing bomb on its target.
The other player plays as the Luftwaffe. They control five fighter planes and are trying to stop the other play from dropping the bouncing bomb by destroying the dambuster.

Players take turns moving one plane at a time until all planes have moved. Every plane must move. Once all the planes in play have been moved, players take turns shooting adversary planes. This loop continues until either the bouncing bomb is droped or the dambuster is destroyed.

When planes move they make move actions. Move actions include; moving forward 1 tile, turn 90 degrees left, turn 90 degress right, increase altitude by 1, and decrease altitude by 1. Figher planes must make 3 move actions when they move. The dambuster makes 2 move actions when it moves.

Planes can only shoot at adversary planes at a lower or equall altitude to themselfs. There are two types of arments; light, and heavy.
Light arments fire more shots but deal less damage and can hit a target upto 2 tiles directly infront.
Heavy arments only fire 1 shot but it deals considerably more damage if it hits. Heavy arments can hit a target upto 3 tiles directly infront.
Fighter planes are equiped with both types of arments. The dambuster only has access to light arments.

The dambuster must be at an altitude of 1 to drop the bouncing bomb.
